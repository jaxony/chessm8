# Testing version 2

New features in this version:

* added tutorial for new players
* added the reward feature

Changes in this version:

* integrated ranking and move feedback into the chessboard

## Feedback

Three users tested the application.

* Ranking UX can be more natural
* Feedback bubbles disappear too quickly
* Rewards need to be better designed and integrated into the user's gameplay (e.g. suggestions)
* UX for applying rewards is unclear
* Points from moves should be tallied and used for some purpose: e.g. redeeming rewards
* Feedback is too detailed: Could round off the numbers
* Need feedback for check and checkmate
